      More flexible than the single configuration file is it to
      configure libpam via the contents of the
      <filename>/etc/pam.d/</filename> directory. In this case the
      directory is filled with files each of which has a filename
      equal to a service-name (in lower-case): it is the personal
      configuration file for the named service.
    </para>

    <para>
      The syntax of each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to that of the
      <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> file and is made up of lines
      of the following form:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
type  control  module-path  module-arguments
    </programlisting>

    <para>
      The only difference being that the service-name is not present. The
      service-name is of course the name of the given configuration file.
      For example, <filename>/etc/pam.d/login</filename> contains the
      configuration for the <emphasis remap='B'>login</emphasis> service.
