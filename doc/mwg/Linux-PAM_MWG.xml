        This manual documents what a programmer needs to know in order
        to write a module that conforms to the
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> standard.It also
        discusses some security issues from the point of view of the

      <para>
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> (Pluggable Authentication
        Modules for Linux) is a library that enables the local system
        administrator to choose how individual applications authenticate
        users. For an overview of the
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> library see the
        <emphasis>Linux-PAM System Administrators' Guide</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        A <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> module is a single
        executable binary file that can be loaded by the
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> interface library.
        This PAM library is configured locally with a system file,
        <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename>, to authenticate a user
        request via the locally available authentication modules. The
        modules themselves will usually be located in the directory
        <filename>/lib/security</filename> (or
        <filename>/lib64/security</filename>, depending on the architecture)
        and take the form of dynamically loadable object files (see
        <citerefentry>
          <refentrytitle>dlopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum>
        </citerefentry>. Alternatively, the modules can be statically
        linked into the <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> library;
        this is mostly to allow <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> to
        be used on platforms without dynamic linking available, but this is
        a <emphasis>deprecated</emphasis> functionality. It is the
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> interface that is called
        by an application and it is the responsibility of the library to
        locate, load and call the appropriate functions in a
        <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis>-module.
      </para>
      <para>
        Except for the immediate purpose of interacting with the user
        (entering a password etc..) the module should never call the
        application directly. This exception requires a "conversation
        mechanism" which is documented below.

    <title>What is expected of a module</title>
    <para>
      The module must supply a sub-set of the six functions listed
      below. Together they define the function of a
      <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM module</emphasis>. Module developers
      are strongly urged to read the comments on security that follow
      this list.
    </para>
    <section id="mwg-expected-of-module-overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>
        The six module functions are grouped into four independent
        management groups. These groups are as follows:
        <emphasis>authentication</emphasis>, <emphasis>account</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>session</emphasis> and <emphasis>password</emphasis>.
        To be properly defined, a module must define all functions within
        at least one of these groups. A single module may contain the
        necessary functions for <emphasis>all</emphasis> four groups.
      </para>
      <section id="mwg-expected-of-module-overview-1">
        <title>Functional independence</title>
        <para>
          The independence of the four groups of service a module can
          offer means that the module should allow for the possibility
          that any one of these four services may legitimately be called
          in any order. Thus, the module writer should consider the
          appropriateness of performing a service without the prior
          success of some other part of the module.
        </para>
        <para>
          As an informative example, consider the possibility that an
          application applies to change a user's authentication token,
          without having first requested that
          <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> authenticate the
          user. In some cases this may be deemed appropriate: when
          <command>root</command> wants to change the authentication
          token of some lesser user. In other cases it may not be
          appropriate: when <command>joe</command> maliciously wants
          to reset <command>alice</command>'s password; or when anyone
          other than the user themself wishes to reset their
          <emphasis>KERBEROS</emphasis> authentication token. A policy
          for this action should be defined by any reasonable
          authentication scheme, the module writer should consider
          this when implementing a given module.

        <title>Minimizing administration problems</title>
        <para>
          To avoid system administration problems and the poor
          construction of a <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> file,
          the module developer may define all six of the following
          functions. For those functions that would not be called,
          the module should return <errorname>PAM_SERVICE_ERR</errorname>
          and write an appropriate message to the system log. When
          this action is deemed inappropriate, the function would
          simply return <errorname>PAM_IGNORE</errorname>.

        <para>
          The <parameter>flags</parameter> argument of each of
          the following functions can be logically OR'd with
          <parameter>PAM_SILENT</parameter>, which is used to inform the
          module to not pass any <emphasis>text</emphasis> (errors or
          warnings) application.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <parameter>argc</parameter> and <parameter>argv</parameter>
          arguments are taken from the line appropriate to this
          module---that is, with the <emphasis>service_name</emphasis>
          matching that of the application---in the configuration file
          (see the <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis>
          System Administrators' Guide). Together these two parameters
          provide the number of arguments and an array of pointers to
          the individual argument tokens. This will be familiar to C
          programmers as the ubiquitous method of passing command arguments
          to the function <function>main()</function>. Note, however, that
          the first argument (<parameter>argv[0]</parameter>) is a true
          argument and <emphasis>not</emphasis> the name of the module.

          Care should be taken to ensure that the proper execution

          If a module is unable to open sufficient files to perform its

        <para>
          Generally, the module may wish to establish the identity of
          the user requesting a service. This may not be the same as
          the username returned by <function>pam_get_user()</function>.
          Indeed, that is only going to be the name of the user under
          whose identity the service will be given. This is not
          necessarily the user that requests the service.
        </para>
        <para>
          In other words, user X runs a program that is setuid-Y, it
          grants the user to have the permissions of Z. A specific example
          of this sort of service request is the <command>su</command>
          program: user <command>joe</command> executes
          <command>su</command> to become the user <command>jane</command>.
          In this situation X=<command>joe</command>, Y=<command>root</command>
          and Z=<command>jane</command>. Clearly, it is important that

          is ostensibly for security reasons, but a maliciously
          programmed application will always have access to all memory
          of the process, so it is only superficially enforced. As a
          general rule the module should overwrite authentication tokens
          as soon as they are no longer needed. Especially before
          <function>free()</function>'ing them. The
          <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis> library is

        <para>
          Not to dwell too little on this concern; should the module
          store the authentication tokens either as (automatic) function
          variables or using <function>pam_[gs]et_data()</function> the

          explicitly overwrite the <varname>*data</varname> before

        With a few exceptions, the level of logging is, at the discretion
        of the module developer. Here is the recommended usage of different
        logging levels:

            As a general rule, errors encountered by a module should be
            logged at the <emphasis>LOG_ERR</emphasis> level. However,
            information regarding an unrecognized argument, passed to a
            module from an entry in the <filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename>
            file, is <emphasis>required</emphasis> to be logged at the

            at the <emphasis>LOG_DEBUG</emphasis> level.

            If a module discovers that its personal configuration
            file or some system file it uses for information is

            by logging messages at level, <emphasis>LOG_ALERT</emphasis>.

        Writing a module is much like writing an application. You
        have to provide the "conventional hooks" for it to work
        correctly, like <function>pam_sm_authenticate()</function>
        etc., which would correspond to the <function>main()</function>
        function in a normal function.

        Typically, the author may want to link against some standard system
        libraries. As when one compiles a normal program, this can be
        done for modules too: you simply append the
        <parameter>-l</parameter><emphasis>XXX</emphasis> arguments
        for the desired libraries when you create the shared module object.
        To make sure a module is linked to the
        <command>libwhatever.so</command> library
        when it is <function>dlopen()</function>ed, try:
        <programlisting>
% gcc -shared -o pam_module.so pam_module.o -lwhatever

      Thanks are also due to Sun Microsystems, especially to Vipin Samar and
      Charlie Lai for their advice. At an early stage in the development of
      <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis>, Sun graciously made the
      documentation for their implementation of PAM available. This act
      greatly accelerated the development of
      <emphasis remap='B'>Linux-PAM</emphasis>.
