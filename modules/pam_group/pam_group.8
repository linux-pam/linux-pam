.SH "NAME"
pam_group - PAM module for group access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBpam_group\.so\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the authentication module) to the user\. Such memberships are based on the service they are applying for\.
.PP
By default rules for group memberships are taken from config file
\fI/etc/security/group\.conf\fR\.
.PP
This module\'s usefulness relies on the file\-systems accessible to the user\. The point being that once granted the membership of a group, the user may attempt to create a
\fBsetgid\fR
binary with a restricted group ownership\. Later, when the user is not given membership to this group, they can recover group membership with the precompiled binary\. The reason that the file\-systems that the user has access to are so significant, is the fact that when a system is mounted
\fInosuid\fR
the user is unable to create or execute such a binary file\. For this module to provide any level of security, all file\-systems that the user has write access to should be mounted
\fInosuid\fR\.
.PP
The pam_group module fuctions in parallel with the
\fI/etc/group\fR
file\. If the user is granted any groups based on the behavior of this module, they are granted
\fIin addition\fR
to those entries
\fI/etc/group\fR
(or equivalent)\.
