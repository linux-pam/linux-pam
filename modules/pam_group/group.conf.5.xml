    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead
      it grants group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the
      authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the
      service they are applying for.
    </para>
    <para>
      For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly
      formatted <filename>/etc/security/group.conf</filename> file present.
      White spaces are ignored and lines maybe extended with '\' (escaped
      newlines). Text following a '#' is ignored to the end of the line.
   </para>

    <para>
      The syntax of the lines is as follows:
    </para>

    <para>
      <replaceable>services</replaceable>;<replaceable>ttys</replaceable>;<replaceable>users</replaceable>;<replaceable>times</replaceable>;<replaceable>groups</replaceable>
    </para>


    <para>
      The first field, the <replaceable>services</replaceable> field, is a logic list
      of PAM service names that the rule applies to.
    </para>

    <para>
      The second field, the <replaceable>tty</replaceable>
      field, is a logic list of terminal names that this rule applies to.
    </para>

    <para>
      The third field, the <replaceable>users</replaceable>
      field, is a logic list of users, or a UNIX group, or a netgroup of
      users to whom this rule applies. Group names are preceded by a '%'
      symbol, while netgroup names are preceded by a '@' symbol.
    </para>

    <para>
      For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once.
      With UNIX groups or netgroups no wildcards or logic operators
      are allowed.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <replaceable>times</replaceable> field is used to indicate "when"
      these groups are to be given to the user. The format here is a logic
      list of day/time-range entries. The days are specified by a sequence of
      two character entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday.
      Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all weekdays
      bar Monday. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
      Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week-end days and all 7 days of the week
      respectively. As a final example, AlFr means all days except Friday.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate "anything but".
      The time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen,
      indicating the start and finish time (if the finish time is smaller
      than the start time it is deemed to apply on the following day).
    </para>

    <para>
      The <replaceable>groups</replaceable> field is a comma or space
      separated list of groups that the user inherits membership of. These
      groups are added if the previous fields are satisfied by the user's request.
    </para>

    <para>
      For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied
      by the applying process.
    </para>
