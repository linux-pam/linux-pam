pam_nologin — Prevent non-root users from login

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_nologin is a PAM module that prevents users from logging into the system
when /etc/nologin exists. The contents of the /etc/nologin file are displayed
to the user. The pam_nologin module has no effect on the root user's ability to
log in.

OPTIONS

file=/path/nologin

    Use this file instead the default /etc/nologin.

successok

    Return PAM_SUCCESS if no file exists, the default is PAM_IGNORE.

EXAMPLES

The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:

auth  required  pam_nologin.so


NOTES

In order to make this module effective, all login methods should be secured by
it. It should be used as a required method listed before any sufficient methods
in order to get standard Unix nologin semantics. Note, the use of successok
module argument causes the module to return PAM_SUCCESS and as such would break
such a configuration - failing sufficient modules would lead to a successful
login because the nologin module succeeded.
