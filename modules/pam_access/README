pam_access — PAM module for logdaemon style login access control

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It provides
logdaemon style login access control based on login names, host or domain
names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on terminal line names in case
of non-networked logins.

By default rules for access management are taken from config file /etc/security
/access.conf if you don't specify another file.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access based on origin (host or tty).

OPTIONS

accessfile=/path/to/access.conf

    Indicate an alternative access.conf style configuration file to override
    the default. This can be useful when different services need different
    access lists.

debug

    A lot of debug informations are printed with syslog(3).

noaudit

    Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit subsystem.

fieldsep=separators

    This option modifies the field separator character that pam_access will
    recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For example: fieldsep
    =| will cause the default `:' character to be treated as part of a field
    value and `|' becomes the field separator. Doing this may be useful in
    conjuction with a system that wants to use pam_access with X based
    applications, since the PAM_TTY item is likely to be of the form
    "hostname:0" which includes a `:' character in its value. But you should
    not need this.

listsep=separators

    This option modifies the list separator character that pam_access will
    recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For example: listsep
    =, will cause the default ` ' (space) and `\t' (tab) characters to be
    treated as part of a list element value and `,' becomes the only list
    element separator. Doing this may be useful on a system with group
    information obtained from a Windows domain, where the default built-in
    groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space.

nodefgroup

    The group database will not be used for tokens not identified as account
    name.

EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
access.conf.

User root should be allowed to get access via cron, X11 terminal :0, tty1, ...,
tty5, tty6.

+ : root : crond :0 tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6

User root should be allowed to get access from hosts which own the IPv4
addresses. This does not mean that the connection have to be a IPv4 one, a IPv6
connection from a host with one of this IPv4 addresses does work, too.

+ : root : 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.4 192.168.200.9

+ : root : 127.0.0.1

User root should get access from network 192.168.201. where the term will be
evaluated by string matching. But it might be better to use network/netmask
instead. The same meaning of 192.168.201. is 192.168.201.0/24 or 192.168.201.0/
255.255.255.0.

+ : root : 192.168.201.

User root should be able to have access from hosts foo1.bar.org and
foo2.bar.org (uses string matching also).

+ : root : foo1.bar.org foo2.bar.org

User root should be able to have access from domain foo.bar.org (uses string
matching also).

+ : root : .foo.bar.org

User root should be denied to get access from all other sources.

- : root : ALL

User foo and members of netgroup admins should be allowed to get access from
all sources. This will only work if netgroup service is available.

+ : @admins foo : ALL

User john and foo should get access from IPv6 host address.

+ : john foo : 2001:4ca0:0:101::1

User john should get access from IPv6 net/mask.

+ : john : 2001:4ca0:0:101::/64

Disallow console logins to all but the shutdown, sync and all other accounts,
which are a member of the wheel group.

-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL

All other users should be denied to get access from all sources.

- : ALL : ALL
