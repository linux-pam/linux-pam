pam_limits — PAM module to limit resources

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_limits PAM module sets limits on the system resources that can be
obtained in a user-session. Users of uid=0 are affected by this limits, too.

By default limits are taken from the /etc/security/limits.conf config file.
Then individual files from the /etc/security/limits.d/ directory are read. The
files are parsed one after another in the order of "C" locale. The effect of
the individual files is the same as if all the files were concatenated together
in the order of parsing. If a config file is explicitely specified with a
module option then the files in the above directory are not parsed.

The module must not be called by a multithreaded application.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access based on limit of maximum number of concurrent login sessions.

OPTIONS

change_uid

    Change real uid to the user for who the limits are set up. Use this option
    if you have problems like login not forking a shell for user who has no
    processes. Be warned that something else may break when you do this.

conf=/path/to/limits.conf

    Indicate an alternative limits.conf style configuration file to override
    the default.

debug

    Print debug information.

utmp_early

    Some broken applications actually allocate a utmp entry for the user before
    the user is admitted to the system. If some of the services you are
    configuring PAM for do this, you can selectively use this module argument
    to compensate for this behavior and at the same time maintain system-wide
    consistency with a single limits.conf file.

noaudit

    Do not report exceeded maximum logins count to the audit subsystem.

EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
limits.conf.

*               soft    core            0
*               hard    rss             10000
@student        hard    nproc           20
@faculty        soft    nproc           20
@faculty        hard    nproc           50
ftp             hard    nproc           0
@student        -       maxlogins       4
