pam_userdb:
	Look up users in a .db database and verify their password against
	what is contained in that database.  The database will have been
	created using db_load.

RECOGNIZED ARGUMENTS:
	debug		write a message to syslog indicating success or
			failure.

	db=[path]	use the [path] database for performing lookup. There
			is no default; the module will return PAM_IGNORE if
			no database is provided.  Some versions of DB will
			automatically append ".db" to whatever pathname you
			supply here.
			
	crypt=[mode]	indicates whether encrypted or plaintext passwords
	                are stored in the database.  If [mode] is "crypt", 
			passwords should be stored in the database in 
		        crypt(3) form.	If [mode] is "none" or any other 
	                value, passwords should be stored in the database in
			plaintext.

	icase		make the password verification to be case insensitive
			(ie when working with registration numbers and such)
			only works with plaintext password storage.

	dump		dump all the entries in the database to the log (eek,
			don't do this by default!)

	try_first_pass	use the authentication token previously obtained by
			another module that did the conversation with the
			application.  If this token can not be obtained then
			the module will try to converse. This option can
			be used for stacking different modules that need to
			deal with the authentication tokens.

	use_first_pass	use the authentication token previously obtained by
			another module that did the conversation with the
			application.  If this token can not be obtained then
			the module will fail. This option can be used for
			stacking different modules that need to	deal with
			the authentication tokens.

	unknown_ok	do not return error when checking for a user that is
			not in the database. This can be used to stack more
			than one pam_userdb module that will check a
			username/password pair in more than a database.

	key_only	the username and password are concatenated together
			in the database hash as 'username-password' with a
			random value.  if the concatenation of the username and
			password with a dash in the middle returns any result,
			the user is valid.  this is useful in cases where
			the username may not be unique but the username and
			password pair are.

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED:
	auth		_authentication and _setcred (blank)

EXAMPLE USE:
	auth  sufficient pam_userdb.so icase db=/etc/dbtest.db
