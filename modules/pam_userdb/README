pam_userdb:
	Look up users in a .db database and verify their password against
	what is contained in that database.

RECOGNIZED ARGUMENTS:
	debug		write a message to syslog indicating success or
			failure.

	db=[path]	use the [path] database for performing lookup. There
			is no default; the module will return PAM_IGNORE if
			no database is provided.
			
	crypt=[mode]	indicates whether encrypted or plaintext passwords
	                are stored in the database.  If [mode] is "crypt", 
			passwords should be stored in the database in 
		        crypt(3) form.	If [mode] is "none" or any other 
	                value, passwords should be stored in the database in
			plaintext.

	icase		make the password verification to be case insensitive
			(ie when working with registration numbers and such)
			only works with plaintext password storage.

	dump		dump all the entries in the database to the log (eek,
			don't do this by default!)

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED:
	auth		_authetication and _setcred (blank)

EXAMPLE USE:
	auth  sufficient pam_userdb.so icase db=/tmp/dbtest.db
