pam_userdb — PAM module to authenticate against a db database

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_userdb module is used to verify a username/password pair against values
stored in a Berkeley DB database. The database is indexed by the username, and
the data fields corresponding to the username keys are the passwords.

OPTIONS

crypt=[crypt|none]

    Indicates whether encrypted or plaintext passwords are stored in the
    database. If it is crypt, passwords should be stored in the database in
    crypt(3) form. If none is selected, passwords should be stored in the
    database as plaintext.

db=/path/database

    Use the /path/database database for performing lookup. There is no default;
    the module will return PAM_IGNORE if no database is provided.

debug

    Print debug information.

dump

    Dump all the entries in the database to the log. Don't do this by default!

icase

    Make the password verification to be case insensitive (ie when working with
    registration numbers and such). Only works with plaintext password storage.

try_first_pass

    Use the authentication token previously obtained by another module that did
    the conversation with the application. If this token can not be obtained
    then the module will try to converse. This option can be used for stacking
    different modules that need to deal with the authentication tokens.

use_first_pass

    Use the authentication token previously obtained by another module that did
    the conversation with the application. If this token can not be obtained
    then the module will fail. This option can be used for stacking different
    modules that need to deal with the authentication tokens.

unknown_ok

    Do not return error when checking for a user that is not in the database.
    This can be used to stack more than one pam_userdb module that will check a
    username/password pair in more than a database.

key_only

    The username and password are concatenated together in the database hash as
    'username-password' with a random value. if the concatenation of the
    username and password with a dash in the middle returns any result, the
    user is valid. this is useful in cases where the username may not be unique
    but the username and password pair are.

EXAMPLES

auth  sufficient pam_userdb.so icase db=/etc/dbtest.db
