pam_unix — Module for traditional password authentication

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

This is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from
the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as
authentication. Usually this is obtained from the /etc/passwd and the /etc/
shadow file as well if shadow is enabled.

The account component performs the task of establishing the status of the
user's account and password based on the following shadow elements: expire,
last_change, max_change, min_change, warn_change. In the case of the latter, it
may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the
PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD return, delay giving service to the user until they have
established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the
shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of
these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed.

The authentication component performs the task of checking the users
credentials (password). The default action of this module is to not permit the
user access to a service if their official password is blank.

A helper binary, unix_chkpwd(8), is provided to check the user's password when
it is stored in a read protected database. This binary is very simple and will
only check the password of the user invoking it. It is called transparently on
behalf of the user by the authenticating component of this module. In this way
it is possible for applications like xlock(1) to work without being
setuid-root. The module, by default, will temporarily turn off SIGCHLD handling
for the duration of execution of the helper binary. This is generally the right
thing to do, as many applications are not prepared to handle this signal from a
child they didn't know was fork()d. The noreap module argument can be used to
suppress this temporary shielding and may be needed for use with certain
applications.

The password component of this module performs the task of updating the user's
password.

The session component of this module logs when a user logins or leave the
system.

Remaining arguments, supported by others functions of this module, are silently
ignored. Other arguments are logged as errors through syslog(3).

OPTIONS

debug

    Turns on debugging via syslog(3).

audit

    A little more extreme than debug.

nullok

    The default action of this module is to not permit the user access to a
    service if their official password is blank. The nullok argument overrides
    this default.

try_first_pass

    Before prompting the user for their password, the module first tries the
    previous stacked module's password in case that satisfies this module as
    well.

use_first_pass

    The argument use_first_pass forces the module to use a previous stacked
    modules password and will never prompt the user - if no password is
    available or the password is not appropriate, the user will be denied
    access.

nodelay

    This argument can be used to discourage the authentication component from
    requesting a delay should the authentication as a whole fail. The default
    action is for the module to request a delay-on-failure of the order of two
    second.

use_authtok

    When password changing enforce the module to set the new password to the
    one provided by a previously stacked password module (this is used in the
    example of the stacking of the pam_cracklib module documented above).

not_set_pass

    This argument is used to inform the module that it is not to pay attention
    to/make available the old or new passwords from/to other (stacked) password
    modules.

nis

    NIS RPC is used for setting new passwords.

remember=n

    The last n passwords for each user are saved in /etc/security/opasswd in
    order to force password change history and keep the user from alternating
    between the same password too frequently.

shadow

    Try to maintain a shadow based system.

md5

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the MD5 algorithm.

bigcrypt

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the DEC C2
    algorithm.

broken_shadow

    Ignore errors reading shadow inforation for users in the account management
    module.

Invalid arguments are logged with syslog(3).

EXAMPLES

An example usage for /etc/pam.d/login would be:

# Authenticate the user
auth       required   pam_unix.so
# Ensure users account and password are still active
account    required   pam_unix.so
# Change the users password, but at first check the strength
# with pam_cracklib(8)
password   required   pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=6 difok=3
password   required   pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5
session    required   pam_unix.so
