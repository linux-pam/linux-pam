pam_securetty — Limit root login to special devices

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the user is
logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing in /etc/securetty.
pam_securetty also checks to make sure that /etc/securetty is a plain file and
not world writable.

This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the application
fills in the PAM_TTY item correctly.

For canonical usage, should be listed as a required authentication method
before any sufficient authentication methods.

OPTIONS

EXAMPLES

auth  required  pam_securetty.so
