pam_selinux — PAM module to set the default security context

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

In a nutshell, pam_selinux sets up the default security context for the next
execed shell.

When an application opens a session using pam_selinux, the shell that gets
executed will be run in the default security context, or if the user chooses
and the pam file allows the selected security context. Also the controlling tty
will have it's security context modified to match the users.

Adding pam_selinux into a pam file could cause other pam modules to change
their behavior if the exec another application. The close and open option help
mitigate this problem. close option will only cause the close portion of the
pam_selinux to execute, and open will only cause the open portion to run. You
can add pam_selinux to the config file twice. Add the pam_selinux close as the
executes the open pass through the modules, pam_selinux open_session will
happen last. When PAM executes the close pass through the modules pam_selinux
close_session will happen first.
